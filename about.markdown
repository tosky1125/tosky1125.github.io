Hey there! I'm Seung-Ha, a backend developer who loves building things that scale. For the past 6+ years, I've been knee-deep in code, working on everything from real-time chat systems to complex financial platforms.

Currently, I'm based in Germany working at Everest Systems, where I get to architect cloud-based ERP solutions that handle millions of transactions daily. It's challenging, it's fun, and I get to work with an amazing team while solving real business problems.

## My Journey

### What I'm Doing Now
**Everest Systems GmbH | 2022 - Present**

At Everest, I lead backend development for our cloud ERP platform. It's been quite a ride:

- Migrated an entire NetSuite system to Stripe without losing a single transaction
- Built an accounting module that speaks 50+ different accounting languages (yes, they're all different!)
- Keep our services running at 99.9% uptime (those 3am alerts taught me a lot about resilience - both the system's and mine)
- Mentor junior developers and learn something new from them every day


## What I Work With

Over the years, I've gotten my hands dirty with quite a tech stack:

**Languages I speak:** Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, SQL  
**Frameworks I love:** Spring Framework, Node.js, Express, NestJS  
**Cloud stuff:** AWS (yes, I'm certified!), Kubernetes (CKA certified too), Docker, Terraform  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis - each has its place!

## Certifications
Because sometimes you need to prove you know what you're talking about:
- 🏆 CKA: Certified Kubernetes Administrator
- 🏆 AWS Solutions Architect Associate
